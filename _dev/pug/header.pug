        Giant ascii art embedded in every page of your site is how you
        show other people that YOU CARE. Mainly I care about developers,
        which is what I presume you are if you're all about viewing
        the source. Clearly you're my kind of person.

        It's run through Jekyll, it's been fun to build,
        there's always more to do, and you may notice that aside from
        Google Analytics there is no JavaScript. None.

        That's one way of many you keep your pages fast. I care about
        keeping this site fast because your time is precious and I need
        to get out of your way.
